"UNEP adaptation gap report suggested adaptation costs ""in developing countries alone"" could reach $140-300bn in 2030, which echoes language in the Paris Agreement urging a ""balance between adaptation and mitigation"" finance. Extreme weather events and unimaginable destructions throughout the world are clear proof there is more we should do other than mitigation and adaptation i.e., recognize and compensate for loss and damage. There have been estimations that have placed the costs of loss and damage at $300-700bn by 2030, rising to $1.2tn per year by 2060. Huge climate finance is required to implement the scale of action demanded by the urgency of the climate crisis.","adaptation costs ""in developing countries alone"" could reach $140-300bn in 2030|There have been estimations that have placed the costs of loss and damage at $300-700bn by 2030, rising to $1.2tn per year by 2060.

For the forestry sector, the four mitigation actions focus on maintaining the existing forest and forest carbon stocks by preventing deforestation and forest degradation; expanding the forest and carbon sinks through afforestation, reforestation, agroforestry and the establishment of urban green landscapes; promoting and maintaining sustainable forest and non-timber forest products; and increasing the efficiency of forest resources. The Lao People's Democratic Republic reported potential emission reductions of 60,000-69,000 kt CO₂ eq to be achieved by maintaining existing forest and carbon sinks.

In the 2018-2019 period, based on the recommendations for gender integration in the Fifth National Communication and the Third BUR, a process of analysis of the feasibility of gender integration in the INGEI was carried out. The objective of this process was to identify the possibility of obtaining population data, and from it, the disaggregation by sex of the sources that report to the INGEI. For this, a sectoral consultation was carried out that allowed us to have a first general knowledge about the viability of each sector with respect to this information. The conclusion was that although it is not possible to automatically generate emission data disaggregated by sex, there are differences between the categories reported in relation to the feasibility of doing so. As an intangible result, it must be expressed that this process allowed problematizing with the sectors that report to the INGEI about the relevance and potential of having this information, an aspect that may be considered in new information generation designs.",,gender integration|gender integration|sex|sex,,,,

"African and other developing countries will require significant levels of international support to contribute effectively to achieving the long-term global temperature goal, and to build resilience at a time when many developing countries are facing severe debt crises, exacerbated by the COVID crisis. The issue of debt crisis is a particularly serious concern for African countries that has been, compounded by the challenge of the pandemic. The continent's debt burden is estimated at 70% of the GDP. A report by the IIED, based on World Bank data shows that on average, debt stocks in the 40 sub-Saharan African countries increased by 33.4% as a percentage of Gross National Income (GNI) between 2018 and 2020. Even before the Covid-19 pandemic, many African countries were already facing high debt burdens with 31 of the 37 countries classified as Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) from in Africa. Understanding of the fairness of Africa's efforts to address climate change and this unsustainable debt burden should take cognisance of factors including the historical colonial legacy underlying Africa's current external trade relations whereby Africa's exports is dominated by climate sensitive primary products, and fossil and mineral resources. These factors should form a critical part of the just transition agenda especially if the continent must respond effectively to response measures under the Paris Agreement.",,,,,,70% of the GDP

"The Tonga Climate Resilient Transport Sector Project 2019-2024 (USD 27 million), supported by the World Bank, aims to facilitate the safe, efficient and sustainable movement of people and goods in Tonga while strengthening resiliency of the Transport sector. It has four components. The first; Sectoral and Spatial Planning Tools, involves technical assistance that will improve the way climate change is addressed in Tonga's Transport sectors and allows for the financing of updates to analytical and sector planning tools to enable policymakers to make informed decisions based on the most accurate and up-to-date information available. The second component; Climate Resilient Infrastructure Solutions, involves feasibility studies, design and physical works of identified road, aviation and maritime assets to improve their resilience to climate related hazards and/or events. The third component; Strengthening the Enabling Environment, will provide funding to support institutional and regulatory reforms for Transport sector asset management and maintenance, including measures to strengthen local capacity and to increase the sustainability of climate resilient investments under the project; and the fourth component; Contingency Emergency Response is designed to provide a swift response in the event of an eligible crisis or emergency. by enabling the GoT to ask the World Bank to reallocate project funds to support emergency response and reconstruction.",,strengthen local capacity,,,,investments|financing|funding

However, according to the BUR, the Climate Change Coordinating Unit at the MoE has succeeded in mainstreaming efforts for several key initiatives such as the National Water Sector Strategy, the Ministry of Agriculture Strategy and the National Renewable Energy Action Plan. Most of the mitigation actions are in the energy and forestry sectors, although there are also individual projects that have been or will be implemented in the transport and agriculture sectors.
