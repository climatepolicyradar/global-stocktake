On the one hand, there needs to be recognition, in their engagement, of water resources as a public good. On the other hand, water services have a cost, and private actors and investors have a role to play in improving water management and its role in the fight against climate change. Financial and investment institutions can spur the development, upscaling and uptake of critical technologies, policies and practices through the adoption of bold commitments to water security and through their cascading influence on the entire economy via portfolio holdings, loan books and other assets. Each sends a strong signal from the private sector to government in support of ambitious climate and water policy, serving to close the ambition loop. Mandatory greenhouse gas and water reporting and consideration of climate and water risks in financial decision-making, accompanied by appropriate policy measures, pushes corporate practices away from carbon-intensive, non-resilient water-related practices and towards more sustainable ones. The public and private finance sector will also need to direct investment into the protection of water resources and freshwater ecosystems in addition to strengthening institutional and civil society capacity. Funding for climate change mitigation and adaptation in the water sector must increase, with priority given to the least developed countries. In addition, access to funding must be facilitated for the most disadvantaged countries, regions and communities for as long as is required to build in-country capacity, test innovative funding models (10-15 years) and sustain solutions over the long term. In order to boost resilience to climate change, building financial resilience and addressing wider financial challenges for water are essential.</td>\n",

Land title management and enforcement need to be adapted to local conditions, especially in places where indigenous and subsistence communities who use standing forests for income lack formal titles. In Costa Rica, for instance, landowners lacking formal titles can provide other types of proof or use advance payments based on future yield to start the process of obtaining official land titles (FAO and UNEP, 2020). Additionally, certification systems can be put in place to formalize the protection of forests.

To achieve this, customers, building owners and construction companies must demand, and/or governments regulate, utilization of material efficiency measures and low carbon materials. Building developers and owners and automobile manufacturers can adopt substitutes alongside new practices (i.e. designing for cross-laminated wood or tension-based structures), driven by changing consumer preferences and synergistic value opportunities (i.e. vehicle light weighting electric vehicles yields battery capacity and weight savings). Convergence of net-zero commitments, fast-moving technologies, and improved design practices could spark elevated demand for zero-carbon stee. For example, reduced overspecification of steel can enable adoption of low-carbon steels at zero net cost, driven by building customer, investor-owner, and/or policy requirements. Growing digitalization and remote sensing capabilities could integrate end-to-end product tracking and accounting through value chains to end customers-where additional costs of decarbonized steel are marginal-thus creating premium markets that underlie a lasting business case for decarbonized steel.

       "24  The Climate Change Law envisages the Ministry of Tourism and Environment, and the NEA having a more active role in the coordination and compilation work regarding the GHG inventory. As such, the knowledge of the application of these tools will need to be transferred to these organisations.

       "29  There is a strong focus across multiple projects on installing solar energy systems as a climate resilient measure. For example, to build backup energy systems for critical services such as healthcare, fire services and the police (GCF Build project) and to power carbon neutral power for water pumping and generation (Sustainable Integrated Water Resources Management project).

       "39  4) Droughts in Solomon Islands have caused serious shortages of water supplies. For example the 1997/1998 ENSO had caused reduction of water supplies by 30-40% in Honiara. Flooding also causes serious health risks. For example an increase in urban flooding undermines the water quality of town water supply and services as well as water infrastructure. Saltwater intrusion and sea-level rise has caused damage to water infrastructure and contaminated freshwater supplies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

Road transport is the dominant mode of transport, while domestic shipping (for transportation of people and goods and fishing) is also important. Domestic aviation plays a small role.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "49  Vancouver launched a unique program in 2016 that provides extreme weather shelter spaces to those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness when a community issues an extreme weather alert. The Extreme Weather Response program is an initiative that \"funds community based services to provide temporary emergency shelter spaces during periods of extreme winter weather which threaten the health and safety of homeless individuals\". Emergency shelter, safe refuge, and hospitality are provided by community members, congregations from faith groups, and advocates. The expected outcomes of the Extreme Weather Response program are decreased health and safety risks to homeless people during periods of extreme winter weather and a reduction of street homelessness during extreme winter weather.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "66  The financial and investor communities, alongside empowered citizens, are catalysts of systemic change. On the one hand, there needs to be recognition, in their engagement, of water resources as a public good. On the other hand, water services have a cost, and private actors and investors have a role to play in improving water management and its role in the fight against climate change. Financial and investment institutions can spur the development, upscaling and uptake of critical technologies, policies and practices through the adoption of bold commitments to water security and through their cascading influence on the entire economy via portfolio holdings, loan books and other assets. Each sends a strong signal from the private sector to government in support of ambitious climate and water policy, serving to close the ambition loop. Mandatory greenhouse gas and water reporting and consideration of climate and water risks in financial decision-making, accompanied by appropriate policy measures, pushes corporate practices away from carbon-intensive, non-resilient water-related practices and towards more sustainable ones. The public and private finance sector will also need to direct investment into the protection of water resources and freshwater ecosystems in addition to strengthening institutional and civil society capacity. Funding for climate change mitigation and adaptation in the water sector must increase, with priority given to the least developed countries. In addition, access to funding must be facilitated for the most disadvantaged countries, regions and communities for as long as is required to build in-country capacity, test innovative funding models (10-15 years) and sustain solutions over the long term. In order to boost resilience to climate change, building financial resilience and addressing wider financial challenges for water are essential.   \n",
       "74  Law enforcement needs to be strengthened (FAO and UNEP, 2020). Depending on the local context and the implementation details, granting land titles to individuals or communities has resulted in mixed outcomes (Blackman et al, 2017). Land title management and enforcement need to be adapted to local conditions, especially in places where indigenous and subsistence communities who use standing forests for income lack formal titles. In Costa Rica, for instance, landowners lacking formal titles can provide other types of proof or use advance payments based on future yield to start the process of obtaining official land titles (FAO and UNEP, 2020). Additionally, certification systems can be put in place to formalize the protection of forests. Governments can also improve the funding of existing protected areas, expand them, or create new ones, essentially diminishing agricultural and extractive activities in these areas (UNEP-WCMC and IUCN, 2020).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "91  Businesses: Designers and architects can help to design buildings and cars for longer lifetimes and reduced waste, reducing primary steel demand in 25 to 40 per cent by 2050. To achieve this, customers, building owners and construction companies must demand, and/or governments regulate, utilization of material efficiency measures and low carbon materials. Building developers and owners and automobile manufacturers can adopt substitutes alongside new practices (i.e. designing for cross-laminated wood or tension-based structures), driven by changing consumer preferences and synergistic value opportunities (i.e. vehicle light weighting electric vehicles yields battery capacity and weight savings). Convergence of net-zero commitments, fast-moving technologies, and improved design practices could spark elevated demand for zero-carbon stee. For example, reduced overspecification of steel can enable adoption of low-carbon steels at zero net cost, driven by building customer, investor-owner, and/or policy requirements. Growing digitalization and remote sensing capabilities could integrate end-to-end product tracking and accounting through value chains to end customers-where additional costs of decarbonized steel are marginal-thus creating premium markets that underlie a lasting business case for decarbonized steel. Finally, business can collaborate with governments and green finance to develop at least 20 commercial-scale production facilities this decade, equivalent to 1 per cent of global primary production, in line                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
