degradation have their origins in productive and development activities such
as the expansion of agricultural areas (89,407 ha/year; 65%), the expansion of
residential areas and infrastructure development (16,285 ha/year, 12%), the
unsustainable exploitation of wood (11,412 ha/year, 8%), firewood harvesting and
