In order to achieve the objectives of rural development, which contribute to the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, the main target of the National Rural Development Programme is promoting growth of agriculture sector based on innovative technologies, that is more territorially and environmentally balanced, climate-friendly and resilient and competitive as well as innovative. Therefore, all three objectives of the EAFRD will be implemented: (a) fostering the competitiveness of agriculture; (b) ensuring the sustainable management of natural resources, and climate action; (c) achieving a balanced territorial development of rural economies and communities including the creation and maintenance of employment. On the basis of the analysis of the Lithuanian rural conditions and problems identified, measures will be implemented in all six Union priorities for rural development of the EAFRD and in 16 out of 18 thematic areas. Also, in order to implement properly the EU strategy on Forestry the thematic area related to the improvement of forestry economic value and forest areas expansion has been chosen in addition. The total program budget is EUR 1.978 billion. 36 % of all funds be allocated for climate change mitigation (this amount includes previous programming period). The main targets of the program are switching to organic farming (25 000 hectares), keeping organic farming areas (110 000 hectares). The Lithuanian Rural Development Programme has been formally adopted by the European Commission on 13 February, 2015. It outlines Lithuania's priorities for using EUR 1.9 billion of public money that is available for the period 2014-2020 (EUR 1.6 billion from the EU budget and EUR 0.3 billion of national funding). The main objectives are the modernization and improvement of the economic performance of small and medium-sized farms (nearly 8 000 farms will be supported), the preservation of biodiversity (11% of farmland), better management of soil (8% of farmland), the promotion of organic farming, the creation of new jobs (nearly 2 000) and the development of rural areas and businesses. Almost 150 000 people will be trained. They include farmers, land managers, food industry actors, forest holders and the staff of rural SMEs. Their professional skills will be upgraded.

Since then, ""Let's Do It!"" has spread this model: one country in one day - around the world. To date, 113 countries and over 16 million people have joined us to clean up illegal waste. ""Let's Do It!"" has never been only about cleaning up waste. It also aims to unite the global community, raise awareness and implement true change to achieve our final goal - a clean and healthy planet. Lithuania was one of the first countries to join this movement (campaign started in Lithuania in spring 2008 for the first time). Air pollution reduction was set as the priority of ""Let's Do It!"" in 2016, when about 260 thousand participants took part in the events of the campaign.",1.0,climatepolicyradar/policy-instrument-text-classifier/policy-instrument-text-classifier:latest
