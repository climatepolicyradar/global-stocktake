# Taxonomy Explainer: Renewables

The taxonomy of renewables is defined using the IRENA technology taxonomy, which can be downloaded from the [IRENA website](https://www.irena.org/Data/Downloads/Tools). This source was chosen because IRENA is an internationally recognised authority on renewable energy. The following changes and additions were made to the pre-defined taxonomy to maximise precision:

- All renewable sources relating to heat pumps were placed in their own category, rather than the IRENA’s general category of ‘Other renewable energy’.
- ‘Other renewable energy’ was deleted.
- ‘Multiple renewables’ was deleted.

The taxonomy was adapted to match the 3 hierarchies required for the tool and additions were made to capture acronyms, synonyms, and other grammatical expressions of the concepts within the taxonomy.
