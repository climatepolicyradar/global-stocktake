# Taxonomy Explainer: Climate-related hazards

The taxonomy of climate-related hazards is defined using the UNDRRâ€™s Hazard definition and classification review. This source was chosen because the UNRR is an internationally recognised authority on hazards, including those related and unrelated to climate change. The pre-defined taxonomy of hazards was adapted to remove hazards which were assessed as being decidedly unrelated to climate change. For example, extraterrestrial and seismogenic hazards were not included in the final taxonomy.

The taxonomy was also adapted to match the 3 hierarchies required for the tool and additions were made to capture acronyms, synonyms, and other grammatical expressions of the concepts within the taxonomy. Learn more about our taxonomy methodology.
