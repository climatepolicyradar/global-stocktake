# Taxonomy Explainer: Greenhouse Gases

The taxonomy of greenhouse gases is defined using desk-based research which identified and adapted from a combination of the [World Meteorological Organization](https://public.wmo.int/en/our-mandate/focus-areas/environment/greenhouse-gases) and the [Center for Climate and Energy Solutions](https://www.c2es.org/content/main-greenhouse-gases/).

These sources were chosen as widely recognised and comprehensive sources for a relatively small and well-defined taxonomy. The taxonomy includes both the full names of greenhouse gases, as well as their chemical formulae. 

The taxonomy was designed with 3 hierarchies as required for the tool, and additions to the contributing taxonomies were made to capture acronyms, synonyms, and other grammatical expressions of the concepts within the taxonomy.
