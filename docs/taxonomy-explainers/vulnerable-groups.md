# Taxonomy Explainer: Vulnerable Groups

## Summary

References to impacted and vulnerable groups were identified based on the Paris Agreement. For more information about our approach, please see our [methodology](../README.md)..

## Methodology

The taxonomy of impacted and vulnerable groups was compiled based on the Paris Agreement: “Acknowledging that climate change is a common concern of humankind, Parties should, when taking action to address climate change, respect, promote and consider their respective obligations on human rights, the right to health, the rights of indigenous peoples, local communities, migrants, children, persons with disabilities and people in vulnerable situations and the right to development, as well as gender equality, empowerment of women and intergenerational equity.”

Additions were made to capture semantically-related terms such as ‘girls’ and ‘underrepresented’, ‘marginalised’ and ‘disadvantaged’ groups, peoples and communities to improve the recall of relevant terms. The taxonomy was adapted to match the 3 hierarchies required for the tool and additions were made to capture acronyms, synonyms, and other grammatical expressions of the concepts within the taxonomy.
