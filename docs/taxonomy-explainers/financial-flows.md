# Taxonomy Explainer: Financial Flows

## Summary

References to financial flows were identified based on English-language dictionary definitions in combination with related terms and phrases commonly identified in the literature. For more information about our approach, please see our [methodology](../README.md)..

## Methodology

The taxonomy of financial flows is defined using relevant terms from the Oxford English Dictionary and Merriam-Webster Dictionary to describe the movement of finance, and extracted relevant keywords from content by the [Grantham Research Institute](https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/explainers/what-is-climate-finance-and-where-will-it-come-from/#:~:text=This%20definition%20of%20climate%20finance,sectors%2C%20anywhere%20in%20the%20world.) on Climate Change and the Environment and the [Climate Finance Glossary](https://e-lib.iclei.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Climate%20finance%20glossary.pdf) compiled by ICLEI, URBAN LEDS, UN Habitat and the Transformative Actions Program. 

These sources were chosen because they are likely to represent the widest and most common linguistic expressions of the movement of finance between relevant actors, for e.g. from governments or private institutions. The taxonomy is focused on capturing the movement of finance between relevant actors, as financial actors and types of finance will be captured in other taxonomies. 

The taxonomy was designed with 3 hierarchies as required for this tool, and additions were made to capture acronyms, synonyms, and other grammatical expressions of the concepts within the taxonomy.
