# Taxonomy Explainer: Greenhouse Gases

## Summary

References to greenhouse gases were identified based on sources published by the World Meteorological Organization and the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. For more information about our approach, please see our [methodology](../README.md)..

## Methodology

The taxonomy of greenhouse gases is defined using desk-based research which identified and adapted from a combination of the [World Meteorological Organization](https://public.wmo.int/en/our-mandate/focus-areas/environment/greenhouse-gases) and the [Center for Climate and Energy Solutions](https://www.c2es.org/content/main-greenhouse-gases/).

These sources were chosen as widely recognised and comprehensive sources for a relatively small and well-defined taxonomy. The taxonomy includes both the full names of greenhouse gases, as well as their chemical formulae.

The taxonomy was designed with 3 hierarchies as required for the tool, and additions to the contributing taxonomies were made to capture acronyms, synonyms, and other grammatical expressions of the concepts within the taxonomy. [Learn more about our taxonomy methodology](../README.md).
