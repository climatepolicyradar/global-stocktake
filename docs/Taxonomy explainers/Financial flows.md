# Taxonomy Explainer: Financial Flows

The taxonomy of financial flows is defined using desk-based research which identified relevant terms from the Oxford English Dictionary and Merriam-Webster, and extracted relevant keywords from relevant expert content by the [Grantham Research Institute](https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/explainers/what-is-climate-finance-and-where-will-it-come-from/#:~:text=This%20definition%20of%20climate%20finance,sectors%2C%20anywhere%20in%20the%20world.) and [*ICLEI*](https://e-lib.iclei.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Climate%20finance%20glossary.pdf).

These sources were chosen because they are likely to represent the widest and most common linguistic expressions of the movement of finance between relevant actors. The taxonomy is focused on capturing as many expressions as possible of the movement of finance between relevant actors, as financial actors and types of finance will be captured in subsequent taxonomies. 

The taxonomy was designed with 3 hierarchies as required for the tool, and additions to the contributing taxonomies were made to capture acronyms, synonyms, and other grammatical expressions of the concepts within the taxonomy.
