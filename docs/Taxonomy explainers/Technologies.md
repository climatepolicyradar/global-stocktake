# Taxonomy Explainer: Technologies

The taxonomy of technologies is based on UN Climate Technology Centre and Networkâ€™s [taxonomy of climate technologies](https://www.ctc-n.org/resources/ctcn-taxonomy). This source was chosen because the UN CTCN is an internationally recognised authority on climate-related technologies.

Some of the technologies included in the CTCN taxonomy were excluded. This was either done because the technologies were evaluated as not being sufficiently climate-specific to warrant inclusion in the taxonomy, or because they represented overlap with another taxonomy (for example, policy instruments). For example, we consider *Building standards and codes* as a policy instrument and not a technology, and this was therefore not included in our final taxonomy.

*The taxonomy was also adapted to match the 3 hierarchies required for the tool and additions were made to capture acronyms, synonyms, and other grammatical expressions of the concepts within the taxonomy.
