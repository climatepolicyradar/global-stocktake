# Concept Methodology: Fossil Fuels

## Summary

References to fossil fuels were identified based on the Eurostat glossary definition of fossil fuels and related products. For more information about our approach, please see our [methodology](../README.md)..

## Methodology

The taxonomy of fossil fuels was compiled based on the [Eurostat glossary for fossil fuels](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Glossary:Fossil_fuel) and related products. This source was chosen because Eurostat is an internationally recognised authority and the glossary was structured and comprehensive. The following changes were made to the pre-defined taxonomy to maximise functionality:

- Terms of two or more words which included a word already within the taxonomy were excluded to avoid duplication (e.g. “coking coal” or “coke oven gas” were not included as “coal” and “gas” were already included and will return these results)
- Equivalent acronyms were identified and included using WikiData (e.g. LPG for LNG)
- Non-renewable waste was excluded because it is within the Sectors - Energy taxonomy
- Key fossil fuel-related activities (e.g. flaring) and infrastructure (e.g. offshore rigs) were added.

The taxonomy was also adapted to match the 3 hierarchies required for the tool and additions were made to capture other grammatical expressions of the concepts within the taxonomy.
