# Concept Methodology: Climate-related hazards

## Summary

References to climate-related hazards were identified based on the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction’s Hazard Definition and Classification Review. For more information about our approach, please see our [methodology](../README.md).

## Methodology

The taxonomy of climate-related hazards is defined using the [United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction](https://www.un.org/ldcportal/content/united-nations-office-disaster-risk-reduction-undrr)’s [Hazard definition and classification review](https://www.undrr.org/publication/hazard-definition-and-classification-review-technical-report). This source was chosen because the UNDRR is an internationally recognised authority on hazards, including those related and unrelated to climate change. The pre-defined taxonomy of hazards was adapted to remove hazards which were unrelated to climate change. For example, extraterrestrial and seismogenic hazards were not included in the final taxonomy.
The taxonomy was also adapted to match the 3 hierarchies required for the tool and additions were made to capture acronyms, synonyms, and other grammatical expressions of the concepts within the taxonomy. [Learn more about our taxonomy methodology](../README.md).
